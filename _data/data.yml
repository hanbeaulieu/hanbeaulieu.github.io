    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      My name is James Yang, a Data Scientist / Electrical & Computer Engineer. I obtained my Masters degree in Data Science at the University of Washington - Seattle where I am currently located as well. Prior to that, I got my undergrad degree at Oregon State University in Electrical & Computer Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. [Resume here!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14PNpZOGLKN4x6f8nvfxfZEVhSWDLLfOl/view?usp=sharing)
      
      Here, you can follow my journey from hardware engineering to software development and now data science! I enjoy learning new things and understanding why they work. 
      But don't worry, I also like stepping aside from the computer. I play basketball (can dunk on a very very optimistic day), huge Seahawks fan, and love to create music (piano, guitar, etc.)
